#Stochastic Simulation of Aircraft Arrivals at Jorge Newbery Airport (AEP)

This project models and simulates the behavior of aircraft arriving at Jorge Newbery Airport (AEP) in Buenos Aires, focusing on their approach and landing processes under stochastic congestion and weather conditions. The simulated operating hours run from 6:00 AM to midnight.

The objective of this work is to:
	•	Analyze the system’s performance under different demand levels and weather scenarios
	•	Understand how congestion and adverse conditions impact airport operations
	•	Propose policies that can improve the efficiency and reliability of the system

This simulation provides a framework for evaluating operational strategies and gaining insights into real-world airport dynamics.
